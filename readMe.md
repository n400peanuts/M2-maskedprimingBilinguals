# Projects description
#### Paper entitled: L2 form priming turns into morphological facilitation with growing proficiency ####

This experiment is a masked morphological priming on L1-Italian, L2-English bilinguals. 
Data were collected between November 2016 and September 2017, and consists of 81 participants.
Each of them completed in addition to the masked priming: 
(1) a Proficiency test; 
(2) a Survey about the general linguistic knowledge of L2 (AoA survey).

This repo contains: 
In /raw data, all the participants' data files, separately for ITA and ENG, as they came out from the acquisition procedure.
In /analysis: the pre-processing and the analysis scripts.
In /stimuli: the stimuli used for the masked priming experiment, complete with all covariates (e.g., word frequency, word length).

To replicate the analysis reported in the paper, you simply have to go through this code:
